            The year is 1941. In the heart of Krakow's Jewish Quarter, four
            lives are intertwined. Sarah, a gifted violinist, finds solace in
            her music, a stark contrast to the growing darkness outside. Her
            younger brother, Samuel, is a bookish and gentle soul, his world
            defined by the stories in his worn-out copy of "The Little Prince."
            Their best friend, Elara, is a fiercely independent and pragmatic
            girl, skilled in sewing and a master of observation, always a step
            ahead of the impending doom. Their close friend, David, is a
            blacksmith's apprentice, strong and quiet, his hands calloused from
            work but his heart full of loyalty.

            Life in the ghetto begins with restrictions, a slow tightening of
            the noose. The vibrant streets turn grey. One evening, a friend of
            their parents, a tailor named Mendel, gives Elara a peculiar gift: a
            small, intricately carved wooden bird. He explains it's a family
            heirloom, a symbol of hope and freedom. Elara, with her pragmatic
            nature, tucks it away, not fully understanding its significance.

            As the situation worsens, the four friends find themselves
            separated. Sarah and Samuel are taken to Auschwitz. In the camp,
            Sarah's violin is confiscated, but she manages to hide a small,
            embroidered handkerchief her mother had given her, a token of
            comfort. Samuel, clinging to his book, rips out a single page with a
            drawing of a rose, believing it will remind him of the beauty he
            once knew.

            Meanwhile, Elara and David are sent to a forced labor camp near a
            factory. Elara, with her sewing skills, is put to work mending
            uniforms. She keeps the wooden bird hidden in the lining of her
            coat, its presence a secret source of strength. David, with his
            strong hands, is forced to work in the camp's smithy. He secretly
            forges a small, simple ring from a piece of scrap metal he finds, a
            vow to himself that he will find Elara and the others again.

            The war rages on, and they endure unspeakable horrors, their shared
            memories a fragile lifeline. Sarah and Samuel, through a stroke of
            luck and the kindness of an older prisoner, are able to communicate
            a few times with Elara and David, through a smuggled note. In this
            note, they mention the handkerchief and the page from the book,
            giving them a glimmer of hope that they are still holding on.

            Years pass. The war ends, but the world they knew is gone. Elara and
            David, both survivors, are reunited in a displaced persons camp.
            David has the forged ring, and Elara still has the wooden bird. They
            hold onto these objects, fragments of their past, as they search for
            news of Sarah and Samuel. After months of searching, they receive
            the devastating news that Sarah and Samuel did not survive.

            Their shared grief is immense, but in their hands, the objects—the
            bird and the ring—become more than just keepsakes. They are a
            promise to remember, a testament to the lives that were, and a
            foundation for the lives they must now build. Elara takes the wooden
            bird out of her coat, and David slips the forged ring onto her
            finger. The objects, once tokens of a life interrupted, now signify
            the beginning of a new one, built on the memory of their lost
            friends.
